"""boids -- Boids implementation using Owyl behavior trees.

This module provides example code using the L{owyl} library to
implement the Boids flocking algorithm.

Requirements
============

 Note: this demo requires Pyglet, Rabbyt, cocos2d

  - B{Pyglet}: U{http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyglet}
  - B{Rabbyt}: U{http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Rabbyt}
  - B{cocos}: U{http://cocos2d.org/}


Intent
======

 This example demonstrates the basic usage of Owyl, including:

  - building and running a Behavior Tree, and
  - developing custom behaviors.


Definitions
===========

  - B{behavior}: Any unit of a Behavior Tree, as represented by a task
    node, branch, or group of parallel behaviors.
  - B{task node}: Any atomic Behavior Tree node.
  - B{parent node}/B{parent task}: Any task node that has child nodes.
  - B{branch}: A parent node and all its children.
  - B{node decorator}: A parent node with only one child. Used to add
    functionality to a child.
  - B{leaf node}/B{leaf task}/B{leaf}: A task node that has no children.


Algorithm
=========

 The basic Boids flocking algorithm was developed by Craig
 Reynolds. For more information, see his page at
 U{http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/}.

 It's a very simple algorithm, with three basic behaviors:

  - "B{Separation}: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates"
  - "B{Alignment}: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates"
  - "B{Cohesion}: steer to move toward the average position of local
    flockmates"

 I{(Definitions from C. Reynolds, linked above)}

 This is actually so simple, we wouldn't really need a behavior tree
 to model it, but it's a good place to start.

 Just to spice things up, we've added some extra behavior: boids will
 accelerate as they steer away from too-close flock mates, and they
 will seek to match a global speed. This gives the flock more the
 appearance of a school of fish, rather than a flight of sparrows, but
 it will let us break out some slightly more advanced behaviors.

 The boids will also seek after a fixed point (conveniently, the center
 of the screen), so that we can observe their movement better.


Building the Tree
=================

 See L{Boid.buildTree} below.


Core Behaviors
==============

 The core behaviors are documented below in each task nodes'
 docstring. They are:

  - L{Boid.hasCloseNeighbors}: conditional to detect crowding
  - L{Boid.accelerate}: accelerate at a given rate
  - L{Boid.matchSpeed}: accelerate to match a given speed
  - L{Boid.move}: move straight ahead at current speed
  - L{Boid.seek}: seek a fixed goal position
  - L{Boid.steerToMatchHeading}: match neighbors' average heading
  - L{Boid.steerForSeparation}: steer away from close flockmates
  - L{Boid.steerForCohesion}: steer toward average position of neighbors.


Helpers
=======

 A number of other helper methods clutter up the namespace. Boid also
 inherits from L{steering.Steerable<examples.steering.Steerable>},
 which contains common steering helper methods which will be useful in
 future examples.

        Building the behavior tree is as simple as nesting the
        behavior constructor calls.

        Building the Behavior Tree
        ==========================

         We'll use a L{parallel<owyl.core.parallel>} parent node as
         the root of our tree. Parallel is essentially a round-robin
         scheduler. That is, it will run one step on each its children
         sequentially, so that the children execute parallel to each
         other. Parallel is useful as a root behavior when we want
         multiple behaviors to run at the same time, as with Boids.

         The first call to a task node constructor returns another
         function. Calling I{that} function will return an iterable
         generator. (This behavior is provided by the "@task..."
         family of python decorators found in L{owyl.core}.)
         Generally, you won't have to worry about this unless you're
         writing new parent nodes, but keep it in mind.

         Also note that keyword arguments can be provided at
         construction time (call to task constructor) or at run-time
         (call to visit). The C{blackboard} keyword argument to
         C{visit} will be available to the entire tree. (This is also
         why all nodes should accept C{**kwargs}-style keyword
         arguments, and access.

         Skipping down to the end of the tree definition, we see the
         first use of
         L{visit<owyl.core.visit>}. L{visit<owyl.core.visit>} provides
         the external iterator interface to the tree. Technically,
         it's an implementation of the Visitor pattern. It visits each
         "node" of the behavior tree and iterates over it, descending
         into children as determined by the logic of the parent
         nodes. (In AI terminology, this is a depth-first search, but
         with the search logic embedded in the tree.)
         L{visit<owyl.core.visit>} is also used internally by several
         parent behaviors, including L{parallel<owyl.core.parallel>},
         L{limit<owyl.decorators.limit>}, and
         L{repeatAlways<owyl.decorators.repeatAlways>} in order to
         gain more control over its children.

        L{limit<owyl.decorators.limit>}
        ===============================

         The next parent node we see is
         L{limit<owyl.decorators.limit>}. L{limit<owyl.decorators.limit>}
         is a decorator node designed to limit how often its child is
         run (given by the keyword argument C{limit_period} in
         seconds). This is useful for limiting the execution of
         expensive tasks.

         In the example below, we're using
         L{limit<owyl.decorators.limit>} to clear memoes once every
         0.4 seconds. This implementation of Boids uses
         L{memojito<examples.memojito>} to cache (or "memoize")
         neighbor data for each Boid. Neighbor data is used by each of
         the core behaviors, and is fairly expensive to
         calculate. However, it's constantly changing, so adjusting
         the limit_period will affect the behavior of the flock (and
         the frame rate).

        L{repeatAlways<owyl.decorators.repeatAlways>}
        =============================================

         We next see the L{repeatAlways<owyl.decorators.repeatAlways>}
         decorator node. This does exactly as you might expect: it
         takes a behavior that might only run once, and repeats it
         perpetually, ignoring return values and always yielding None
         (the special code for "I'm not done yet, give me another
         chance to run").

        L{sequence<owyl.decorators.sequence>}
        =============================================

         Runs a sequence of actions. If any action yields False,
         then the rest of the sequence is not executed (the sequence
         is halted).  Otherwise, the next sequence item is run.  In
         this example, a boid accelerates away only if it is too close
         to another boid.

        Core Behaviors
        ==============

         The core behaviors are documented below in each method's
         docstring. They are:

          - L{Boid.hasCloseNeighbors}: conditional to detect crowding
          - L{Boid.accelerate}: accelerate at a given rate
          - L{Boid.matchSpeed}: accelerate to match a given speed
          - L{Boid.move}: move straight ahead at current speed
          - L{Boid.seek}: seek a fixed goal position
          - L{Boid.steerToMatchHeading}: match neighbors' average
            heading
          - L{Boid.steerForSeparation}: steer away from close
            flockmates
          - L{Boid.steerForCohesion}: steer toward average position of
            neighbors.
